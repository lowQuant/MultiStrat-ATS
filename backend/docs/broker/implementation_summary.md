# Broker Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the live and backtest broker classes with unified interface and full ArcticDB persistence according to the agreed architecture.

## Implementation Date
2025-09-18

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Base Broker (`broker/base_broker.py`)
- Abstract base class defining the broker interface
- Implements two-tier equity management:
  1. First checks for explicit strategy equity in `{account_id}/strategy_{symbol}_equity`
  2. Falls back to `target_weight * total_equity` from `general/strategies`
- Abstract methods: `_get_total_equity()`, `place_order()`, `get_positions()`

### 2. LiveBroker (`broker/live_broker.py`)
- Full Interactive Brokers integration via `ib_async`
- Automatic account ID resolution via `ib.managedAccounts()`
- Real-time order and fill event handling
- Persistence features:
  - Orders tracked in `{account_id}/orders`
  - Fills tracked in `{account_id}/fills`
  - Strategy positions in `{account_id}/strategy_{symbol}_positions`
- Calculates order quantities based on equity allocation percentage

### 3. BacktestBroker (`broker/backtest_broker.py`)
- Integration with BacktestEngine for simulated trading
- Generates synthetic account IDs (e.g., `BT_20250918_174616`)
- Simulates immediate fills for market orders
- Full persistence matching live broker structure
- Enables consistent strategy testing across live/backtest modes

## ArcticDB Architecture Implementation

### Account-Specific Libraries
Each account (live or backtest) gets its own library named by account ID:
- Paper accounts: `DU7654321`
- Live accounts: `U1234567`
- Backtest accounts: `BT_{timestamp}`

### Symbols Within Account Libraries
```
{account_id}/
  ├── account_summary      # Daily account metrics
  ├── portfolio            # Account-wide positions
  ├── orders              # Order log with status
  ├── fills               # Execution fills
  ├── trades              # Completed trades
  ├── strategy_{symbol}_equity     # Explicit equity allocation
  └── strategy_{symbol}_positions  # Strategy-specific positions
```

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Interface
Strategies use the same API regardless of execution mode:
```python
# Works in both live and backtest
equity = await self.broker.get_equity()
trade = await self.broker.place_order(contract, order, size=0.5)
positions = await self.broker.get_positions()
```

### 2. Smart Equity Management
- Explicit allocation via `strategy_{symbol}_equity` takes precedence
- Automatic fallback to weighted allocation from `general/strategies`
- No hardcoded values - fully configurable

### 3. Efficient Persistence
- Append-based writes for high-frequency data (orders, fills)
- No whole-table rewrites - uses incremental updates
- Write operations instead of update to avoid index conflicts

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- LiveBroker subscribes to IB events (`orderStatusEvent`, `fillEvent`)
- Automatic persistence on order status changes and fills
- Asynchronous processing to avoid blocking

## Testing Results

### Integration Test Output
✅ All tests passed successfully:
- Account library creation
- Equity retrieval with fallback logic
- Order placement and quantity calculation
- Fill persistence
- Position tracking
- ArcticDB data verification

### Test Coverage
- `test_broker_minimal.py`: Basic functionality without dependencies
- `test_broker_integration.py`: Full workflow with persistence
- Verified 2 orders placed, persisted, and filled correctly

## Usage Example

```python
from broker.live_broker import LiveBroker
from broker.backtest_broker import BacktestBroker

# Live trading
ib = IB()
await ib.connectAsync('127.0.0.1', 7497, clientId=1)
live_broker = LiveBroker(ib, strategy_symbol="TQQQ", arctic_client=ac)

# Backtesting
engine = BacktestEngine()
backtest_broker = BacktestBroker(engine, strategy_symbol="TQQQ", arctic_client=ac)

# Same interface for both
equity = await broker.get_equity()
trade = await broker.place_order(contract, order, size=0.5)
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Core Implementation
- `/backend/broker/base_broker.py` - Updated with proper equity logic
- `/backend/broker/live_broker.py` - Full implementation with persistence
- `/backend/broker/backtest_broker.py` - Full implementation with persistence
- `/backend/broker/__init__.py` - Module exports

### Testing
- `/backend/test_broker_minimal.py` - Basic functionality tests
- `/backend/test_broker_integration.py` - Full integration tests

### Documentation
- `/backend/docs/broker/implementation_summary.md` - This document

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Strategies can now use the broker interface
2. ✅ Test with `broker_test_strategy.py`
3. ✅ Data flows to ArcticDB automatically

### Future Enhancements
1. Add order modification/cancellation support
2. Implement portfolio-wide risk metrics
3. Add performance tracking per strategy
4. Consider adding order routing preferences
5. Implement position sizing helpers

## Acceptance Criteria Met
✅ Strategies can run in both live and backtest modes without code changes
✅ Equity retrieval uses explicit `strategy_{symbol}_equity` when present
✅ Falls back to `target_weight * total_equity` when needed
✅ All persistence occurs inside `{account_id}` library
✅ No whole-dataframe rewrites for frequent updates
✅ Code is ready to run and passes all tests

## Notes
- The implementation respects the user's preference for maximum historical data pagination
- Uses `get_ac()` to respect local/S3 configuration automatically
- All operations are guarded with try/except for robustness
- Logging is comprehensive for debugging and monitoring

## Conclusion
The broker implementation is complete, tested, and ready for production use. It provides a clean abstraction layer that allows strategies to focus on trading logic while the broker handles execution details and persistence transparently.
